# Introduction

This website is intended to provide some guidance on how to get and install
the bml library. LA-UR number LA-UR-**17-27373**.

The basic matrix library (bml) is a collection of various matrix data
formats (for dense and sparse) and their associated algorithms for
basic matrix operations. Application programming interfaces (API) are
available for both C and FORTRAN. The current status of this library
allows us to use two different formats for representing matrix data.
Currently these formats are: dense, ELLPACK-R, ELLBLOCK, ELLSORT, and
CSR. For information on how to use the BML library can be find in
[BML-API](https://lanl.github.io/bml/API/developer_documentation.html).

# Mailing List

We are running the following mailing list for discussions on usage and features of the bml library:

# Supported Matrix Formats

The bml library supports the following matrix formats:

* dense
* ELLPACK-R
* ELLSORT
* ELLBLOCK
* CSR

# Binary Packages

We offer binary packages of the bml library in [RPM
format](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Anicolasbock%3Aqmmd&package=bml)
thanks to SUSE's OpenBuild Service and for Ubuntu in [DEB
format](https://launchpad.net/~nicolasbock/+archive/ubuntu/qmmd).

# Testing in our CI container

We are switching our CI tests from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions because
Travis-CI is [limiting the number of builds for open source
projects](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing).
Our workflow uses a [custom Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nicolasbock/bml) which comes with the
necessary compiler tool chain to build and test the `bml` library.
Using `docker` is a convenient and quick way to develop, build, and
test the `bml` library.

    $ docker pull nicolasbock/bml:latest
    $ docker run --interactive --tty --rm \
        --volume ${PWD}:/bml --workdir /bml \
        --user $(id --user):$(id --group) \
        nicolasbock/bml:latest

Inside the container:

    $ ./build.sh compile

# Build Instructions

The bml library is built with CMake. For convenience, we provide a shell
script which goes through the necessary motions and builds the library, runs
the tests, and installs it (in the `install` directory).

## For a quick installation

We suggest to take a look at the `example_build.sh` script that sets
the most important
environmental variables needed by `build.sh` script. Change the Variables
according to the compilers and architecture. The script can be run just by
doing:

    $ ./example_build.sh

## For a more involved installation

By running:

    $ ./build.sh install

the library will be built in the `build` directory and installed in the
`install` directory. In case you change any sources and simply want to
rebuild the library, you don't have to run `build.sh` again, but rather

    $ make -C build

The compiled library can be installed by running

    $ make -C build install

The install directory can be modified by running

    $ CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path ./build.sh install

(which assumes that you are using the bash shell).

To build with GNU compilers, OpenMP, and Intel MKL do the following.

    $ CC=gcc FC=gfortran \
        BLAS_VENDOR=Intel CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        BML_OPENMP=yes CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path \
        ./build.sh install

To build with MPI, OpenMP, and use Intel MKL do the following.

    $ CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 \
        BLAS_VENDOR=Intel CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        BML_OPENMP=yes BML_MPI=yes CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path \
        ./build.sh install

## Prerequisites

In order to build the library, the following tools need to be installed:

- `gcc` with Fortran support
- `>=cmake-2.8.8`
- `>=python-2.7`
- `>=OpenMP-3.1` (i.e. `>=gcc-4.7`)

## If the build fails

In case the build fails for some reason, please contact the developers by
opening an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/lanl/bml/issues) and attach the
files

    build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log
    build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log

# Developer Suggested Workflow

Our main development happens on the `master` branch and is continuously
verified for correctness. If you would like to contribute with your work to the bml
project, please follow the instructions at the GitHub help page ["About pull
requests"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). To
summarize:

- Fork the project on github
- Clone that forked repository
- Create a branch in it
- Commit any changes to the branch
- Push the branch to your forked repository
- Go to https://github.com/lanl/bml and click on 'Create Pull Request'

During the review process you might want to update your pull
request. Please add commits or `amend` your existing commits as
necessary. If you amend any commits you need to add the
`--force-with-lease` option to the `git push` command. Please make
sure that your pull request contains only one logical change (see
["Structural split of
change"](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Structural_split_of_changes)
for further details.

# Coding Style

Please indent your C code using

    $ indent -gnu -nut -i4 -bli0 -cli4 -ppi0 -cbi0 -npcs -bfda

You can use the script `indent.sh` to indent all C code.
