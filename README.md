# Binary Packages

We offer binary packages of the bml library in [RPM
format](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Anicolasbock%3Aqmmd&package=bml)
thanks to SUSE's OpenBuild Service and for Ubuntu in [DEB
format](https://launchpad.net/~nicolasbock/+archive/ubuntu/qmmd).

# Build Instructions

The bml library is built with CMake.  For convenience, we provide a shell
script which goes through the necessary motions and builds the library, runs
the tests, and installs it (in the `install` directory). Simply run:

    $ ./build.sh install

and the library will be built in the `build` directory and installed in the
`install` directory.  In case you change any sources and simply want to
rebuild the library, you don't have to run `build.sh` again, but rather

    $ make -C build

The compiled library can be installed by running

    $ make -C build install

The install directory can be modified by running

    $ CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path ./build.sh install

(which assumes that you are using the bash shell).

To build with GNU compilers, OpenMP, and Intel MKL do the following.

    $ CC=gcc FC=gfortran \
        BLAS_VENDOR=Intel CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        BML_OPENMP=yes CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path \
        ./build.sh install

To build with MPI, OpenMP, and use Intel MKL do the following.

    $ CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 \
        BLAS_VENDOR=Intel CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        BML_OPENMP=yes BML_MPI=yes CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path \
        ./build.sh install

## Prerequisites

In order to build the library, the following tools need to be installed:

- `gcc` with Fortran support
- `>=cmake-2.8.8`
- `>=python-2.7`
- `>=OpenMP-3.1` (i.e. `>=gcc-4.7`)

## If the build fails

In case the build fails for some reason, please contact the developers by
opening an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/lanl/bml/issues) and attach the
files

    build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log
    build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log

# Developer Suggested Workflow

Our main development happens on the `master` branch and is continuously
verified for correctness. If you would like to contribute your work to the bml
project, please follow the instructions at the GitHub help page ["About pull
requests"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). To
summarize:

- Fork the project on github
- Clone that forked repository
- Create a branch in it
- Commit any changes to the branch
- Push the branch to your forked repository
- Go to https://github.com/lanl/bml and click on 'Create Pull Request'

During the review process you might want to change your pull request. Simply
commit the changes on your local branch and push them GitHub. Please don't
`amend` your commits. This makes it more difficult for the reviewers to follow
your work.

Please make sure your pull request contains only one logical change (see
["Structural split of
change"](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Structural_split_of_changes)
for further details.

## Coding Style

Please indent your C code using

    $ indent -gnu -nut -i4 -bli0 -cli4 -ppi0 -cbi0 -npcs -bfda

You can use the script `indent.sh` to indent all C code.
