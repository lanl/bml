<h1 id="binary-packages">Binary Packages</h1>

<p>We offer binary packages of the bml library in <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Anicolasbock%3Aqmmd&amp;package=bml">RPM
format</a>
thanks to SUSE’s OpenBuild Service and for Ubuntu in <a href="https://launchpad.net/~nicolasbock/+archive/ubuntu/qmmd">DEB
format</a>.</p>

<h1 id="build-instructions">Build Instructions</h1>

<p>The bml library is built with CMake.  For convenience, we provide a shell
script which goes through the necessary motions and builds the library, runs
the tests, and installs it (in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">install</code> directory). Simply run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./build.sh install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>and the library will be built in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> directory and installed in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">install</code> directory.  In case you change any sources and simply want to
rebuild the library, you don’t have to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.sh</code> again, but rather</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ make -C build
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The compiled library can be installed by running</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ make -C build install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The install directory can be modified by running</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path ./build.sh install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(which assumes that you are using the bash shell).</p>

<p>To build with GNU compilers, OpenMP, and Intel MKL do the following.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ CC=gcc FC=gfortran \
    BLAS_VENDOR=Intel CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    BML_OPENMP=yes CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path \
    ./build.sh install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To build with MPI, OpenMP, and use Intel MKL do the following.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 \
    BLAS_VENDOR=Intel CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    BML_OPENMP=yes BML_MPI=yes CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path \
    ./build.sh install
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>In order to build the library, the following tools need to be installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> with Fortran support</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;=cmake-2.8.8</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;=python-2.7</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;=OpenMP-3.1</code> (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;=gcc-4.7</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-the-build-fails">If the build fails</h2>

<p>In case the build fails for some reason, please contact the developers by
opening an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/qmmd/bml/issues) and attach the
files</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log
build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="developer-suggested-workflow">Developer Suggested Workflow</h1>

<p>We do our main development on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.  If you would like to
contribute your work to the bml project, please fork the project on github,
hack away at the forked <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch and send us a pull request once you
think we should have a look and integrate your work.</p>

<h2 id="coding-style">Coding Style</h2>

<p>Please indent your C code using</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ indent -gnu -nut -i4 -bli0 -cli4 -ppi0 -cbi0 -npcs -bfda
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can use the script <code class="highlighter-rouge">indent.sh</code> to indent all C code.</p>
